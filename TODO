ADD SOME TESTS!!!

allow aliasing for pluralizing reverse foreign keys (using Lingua::*??) :
  instead of $department->employee, also allow $department->employees

perhaps in scalar context, a reverse foreign key should return a special
collection object that knows the IDs of all the objects.. that way we can
"map" to do a many-to-many thing:
  $album->tracks->song->name;
although in this case, we may also want the info associated with the
"track" table that's contained here:
  print $_->track_num, $_->song->name for $album->tracks;
so it might only prove useful when we have a relation (as in ER model) with
no associated data... just a many-to-many mapping table. 

of course for this, we'd need some naming scheme for many-to-many
relationships! ;)
